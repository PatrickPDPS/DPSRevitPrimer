# Managing your Revit Model
<br> 
So you're working on a project and you're in the SD phase and just had your meeting with your consultants and you'll have two consultants working in Revit with you as well. We need to show their information in the model, one of which is their sheets, gridlines, column locations, and lights for some examples. So there you are working in Revit and you've received an email from your consultant stating that their model is ready for you to link in, how do you do this? Here we will be discussing best practices on how to link Revit models as well as exporting them to other platforms because not all of our consultants are working in Revit, some of them are working in CAD or maybe you need to create a rendering in Lumion.
