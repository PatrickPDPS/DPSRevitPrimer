#Exporting to CAD
There is really only one method of exporting to CAD format, it's relatively simple to do. You'll need to know what version of CAD your consultant is working in, this way they won't have to go through the trouble of updrading or downgrading the file. Once you know what version of CAD they are running you can now begin to export. You can click on file-export-CAD Formats-DWG (See Below)
