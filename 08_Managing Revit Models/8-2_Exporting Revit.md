#Exporting Revit 
<br>
Alright! So you've met with your consultants and found out that your MEP consultant will be working in CAD while you are working in Revit. You now need to export them a CAD plan for them to work off of. How do you do this? Or you're at a point with the model that you need to create a rendering in Lumion, what do you do?

##Exporting to CAD
There is really only one method of exporting to CAD format, it's relatively simple to do. You'll need to know what version of CAD your consultant is working in, this way they won't have to go through the trouble of updrading or downgrading the file. Once you know what version of CAD they are running you can now begin to export. You can click on file-export-CAD Formats-DWG (See Below)
