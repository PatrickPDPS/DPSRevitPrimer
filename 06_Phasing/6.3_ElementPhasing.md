# Element Phasing
<br>
<br>
Almost every element in Revit is phaseable, openings, grids, annotation are not however. Those that are will have the parameters Phase Created and Phase Demolished. Phase Created is well, when the element is built or when it was built, Phase Demolished is when the element will be removed if at all it will be removed.  
<br>
In the DPS Template you will see multiple phases, for Revit elements you'll only need to be concerned with Existing and New construciton as to what you assign each element.
