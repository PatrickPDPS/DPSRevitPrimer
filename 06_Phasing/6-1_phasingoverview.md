Phasing represents the distinct time period for the life a project, there are two parameters in Revit just for phasing. Phase and Phase Filter, both of which are editable in the properties box of the view or are accesible in a view template. For phasing of an existing and new construction we typically will have an AD-FP view for demolition, AE-FP for new constuction elements, E-FP for existing elements in the working view, N-FP for new elements in the working view. We will be going through what each specific phase and phase filter does to your view(s).
