#DPS Phasing Stanard
<br>
As discussed in the phasing overview, we have a naming standard for our views when phasing is applied with new construction and existing conditions. Revit Support will set up phasing of a project for you, you will be able to notify us in the <a href="/02_DPS Revit Template/2-1_project_start.md">Project Start</a> pdf. This overview is to give you an understanding of how phasing works and if you need to make any adjustments on your current project.
