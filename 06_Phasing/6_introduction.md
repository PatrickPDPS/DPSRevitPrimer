## View Organization

### Why is view organization important?



The reason view organization is important is to keep track of what is going on in our Revit model. This all relates back to file management. If we have a **standard** view organization, this supports **consistent** workflows for all project team members.

>This then results in users duplicating work and the model being less efficient than we would like.
