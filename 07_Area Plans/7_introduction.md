# Scope Boxes
<br>
<br>
## My building wont fit on a 30x42 sheet. How do I manage this?
<br>
<br>
Our projects are getting bigger in the office and we need a method to break up the building so that they fit on the designated sheets rather it be a 24x36 or 30x42. Revit suppport has a method for alliviating this issue, it is the use of scope boxes. You can see these in your working plan as a dashed greenline surrounding your building (See below).
