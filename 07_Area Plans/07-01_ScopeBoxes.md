# Scope Boxes
<br>
## Why do we use scope boxes?
We use scope boxes becasue they ensure that the crop region is the same throughout, this means that our floor plans, reflected ceiling plans and roof plans hold the same crop region and annotation crop ensuring we are not showing more or less than on a different plan. Scope boxes are an annotation category and are hidden automatically in our documentation view templates.

## Scope Box Naming Best Practices
We typically name our scope boxes based on the area of the building they are covering. We typically use an alphabet naming system reason being the letters are what are typically represented for sheet numbering, although you can use what ever other naming your project architect deems appropriate.

## How do we use scope boxes?
When using scope boxes the best practice is to overlap them, you typically want to include a grid or a wall (if a grid is not applicable) just to tie both of the areas togerther when dimensioning. Now how far do we overlap? 1'-0" from the match line (see below) this ensures that there are elements on both areas that carry over, matchlines also carry an unlimited extent meaning you'll need to draw it once and it carry thorugh to all of your levels above as well as elevations.
