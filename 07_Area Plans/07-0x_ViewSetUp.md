# DPS Best Practices for Views
Now that you have your scope boxes placed, we need to now create views for each area that you created. This is done by creating views that are  dependent of the overall view, the reason we do this is you can right click on the overall view and it'll generate the same dependent view for each level and it groups all of the views dependent of the overall neatly.
