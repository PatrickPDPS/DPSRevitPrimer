# Scope Boxes
<br>
## Why do we use scope boxes?
We use scope boxes becasue they ensure that the crop region is the same throughout, this means that our floor plans, reflected ceiling plans and roof plans hold the same crop region and annotation crop ensuring we are not showing more or less than on a different plan. Scope boxes are an annotation category and are hidden automatically in our documentation view templates.
