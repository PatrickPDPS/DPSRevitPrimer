### Revit Support Group

The Revit Support group was established to provide immediate support to users when it comes to our digital process. They are immediately reachable by a single email group RevitSupport@dpsdesign.org

The group consists of 7 total members strategically placed throughout the office.

### Design Technology Leaders

If you require assistance that goes beyond initial troubleshooting and workflows you may need to contact the Design Technology Leaders. This group is in charge of guiding how we utilize technology in the firm as a whole.

This group consists of a representative from every practice area and meets on a monthly basis to discuss best practices, training topics and new items.

### Bluebeam Support

If you require specific assistance when it comes to utilizing Bluebeam, this group can get you the help you need. Although this document aims to lay out DPS' Revit process, this group is essential because a PDF is often our deliverable from Revit.
