## Revit Support Structure

For support when it comes to getting work done in Revit, DPS created a group of individuals to assist you with any needs.

### Revit Support Group

The Revit Support group was established to provide immediate support to users when it comes to our digital process. They are immediately reachable by a single email group RevitSupport@dpsdesign.org

The group consists of four total members strategically placed throughout the office.

### Design Technology LEaders

If you require assistance that goes beyond initial troubleshooting and workflows you may need to contact the Design Technology Leaders. This group is in charge of guiding how we utilize technology in the firm as a whole.

This group consists of a representative from every practice area and meets on a monthly basis to discuss best practices, training topics and new items.
