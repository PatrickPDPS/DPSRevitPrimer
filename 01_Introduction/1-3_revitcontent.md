## Revit Content

To ensure that **all** projects utilize similar content, DPS has a content directory located on the R drive for all offices.

This content library is organized in a familiar fashion. **Master Format** is the logic utilized in this process.

* **Annotation** is a library of typical NCS compliant annotation used in Revit.
* **Design** contains any rendering content such as entourage or signage.
* **Detail Components** are 2D components used for detailing (organized using Master Format as well).
* **Division Content** contains model content organized by respective Master Format division.

>Using windows search in the directory is the simplest method to find content. If you cannot find your content <a href = "1-2_revitsupport.md">Revit Support</a>, will be more than happy to generate it for you.
