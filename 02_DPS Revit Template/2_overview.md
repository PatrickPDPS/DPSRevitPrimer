# DPS Revit template

#### The current Revit template for DPS is **Architecture-2016.rte**

 >Currently Autodesk releases Revit on a yearly cycle in the spring. Shortly after this release Revit Support will test the new release and research changes within the Revit UI. This is generally a process of a few months. During or after this process, the Design Technology Leaders will select a "pilot project" to ensure the new release is stable.

 After this selection process has happened the current release's template will be the only one that gets updated.
