We're going to be going over some of the DPS best practices for annotating your model in terms of the type of annotation to be using. For the majority of the text we deal with is 3/32" in height. The reason we use this is due to the NCS (National CAD Standards) a standard that drawings should follow. All of our best practices are pre-loaded into the Revit template for your convience and for efficiency.
