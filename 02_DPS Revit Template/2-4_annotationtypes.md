We're going to be going over some of the DPS best practices for annotating your model in terms of the type of annotation to be using. For the majority of the text we deal with is 3/32" in height. The reason we use this is due to the NCS (National CAD Standards) a standard that drawings should follow. We rely on the NCS for a lot for how we illustrate our annotation in drawings 

###To do:

- [x] create placeholder page for content
- [ ] generate thumbnails for typical annotation
- [ ] create write up for each annotation
- [ ] discuss NCS and how it relates
