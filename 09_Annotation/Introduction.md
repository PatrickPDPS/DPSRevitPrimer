#Annotation
<br> 
We have our building in a good place, now lets begin to add annotation! Annotation includes an assortment of items including dimensions, tags and keynotes just to name a few. Annotation is very different than normal revit elements, they're view specific. This is another reason why we use dependent views for area plans, we place them on the main view or dependent view and will show up on both.
