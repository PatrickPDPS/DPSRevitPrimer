### What are worksets?

Autodesk's definition of a workset is as follows.

###What does this mean to DPS?

Basically, we utilize worksets in a simplified manner for **entire collections of building elements**. 

This includes, *but is not limited to*:
* Shell and Core Models
* Multi-Building sites
* Host Geometry or Entourage
* Structural Foundations versus Structural Superstructure

###Why do we care? 
Worksets offer the ability to unload **unnecessary** elements from the **entire** model. This includes **linked** models as well.

####The next section will demonstrate the baseline standard that has been adopted by DPS as a best practice.
